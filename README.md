### **1. Escaping from a faling temple**
you are in a pre-historic temple and accidently step on a foundation stone and temple start shaking.you have the map of the temple but you need shorted way out to survive lets see if this code can save you

I am using Q-learning algorithm which is is a reinforcement learning technique used in machine learning. The goal of Q-Learning is to learn a policy, which tells an agent what action to take under what circumstances. It does not require a model of the environment and can handle problems with stochastic transitions and rewards, without requiring adaptations.
